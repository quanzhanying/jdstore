# SeoHelper

SeoHelper is a set of helpers for rendering page-specific `<title>` tag, common `<meta />` tags and `<link rel='image_src' />` tag.

It contains not only a set of `tag()` helper wrappers, but can also help you doing things like

* specifying **title**, **description** and **image_url** for the current page, and render them with `<title>` and corresponding `meta`-tags or `link`-tags
* automatically append **page number** and **site name** into the title (both formats are customizable)

Pull requests are welcome.

# Usage

Add this to your Gemfile:

    gem 'seo_helper', '~> 1.0'

If you want to use the edge version on Github, specify the `:git` option.

    gem 'seo_helper', '~> 1.0', :git => 'git://github.com/xdite/seo_helper.git'

And run

    bundle install

to install this plug-in.

After installation, add `config/initializers/seo_helper.rb` into your Rails application, specifying the basic configuration like this:

```ruby
SeoHelper.configure do |config|
  config.site_name = "My Awesome Web Application"
end
```

Please specify at least the `site_name`, or SeoHelper will take the class name of your Rails application as default.

Don't forget to restart your Rails application.

# Page Title Rendering

It's always been a complex job to render a pretty title and put it in both the `<title>` tag and the title `meta` tag.  With SeoHelper, you can easily set and render the title text.

## Rendering the Default Title in Layout

First, put this in your layout file, between `<head>` and `</head>`:

```ruby
<%= render_page_title_tag %>
```

You can replace the hard-coded `<title>` tag with this helper.

Now visit any page of your application, you'll see that the browser's title will be the `site_name` that you specified (or the application's class name if not specified).

## Specifying the Title

To specify the title of current page in an controller action, for example, in the `Articles#show` action, use `set_page_title`

```ruby
def show
  # ...
  set_page_title @article.title
end
```

Now visit any article, you'll see the title becomes

    Article Title | My Awesome Web Application

The `site_name` is still a part of the title text.

If `params[:page]` exists it'll automatically be appended to the title.  For example, in `Articles#index`, when you visit the 2nd page, you'll see the title becomes

    Article Index - Page 2 | My Awesome Web Application

# Rendering SEO-oriented Tags

For SEO, you may want to put some `<meta>` tags and `<link rel="image-src" />` tag in your webpage.  With SeoHelper, you can easily do these things.

## Rendering Meta Tags for Title, Description and Keywords

First, put this in your layout file, between `<head>` and `</head>`:

```erb
<%= render_page_title_meta_tag %><%# This might be unnecessary %>
<%= render_page_description_meta_tag %>
<%= render_page_keywords_meta_tag %>
```

You can replace the hard-coded `<meta>` tags with these helpers.

To specify the description and keywords of current page in an controller action, for example, in the `Articles#show` action, use `set_page_description`

```ruby
def show
  # ...
  set_page_title       @article.title   # same as <title> tag
  set_page_description @article.excerpt # or @article.content.truncate(100)
  set_page_keywords    @article.tags    # or @article.keywords
end
```

Now visit any article, and open it's source, you'll see these meta tags:

```html
<meta name="title" content="Article Title | My Awesome Web Application" />
<meta name="description" content="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ..." />
<meta name="keywords" content="faketext,lorem,ipsum" />
```

If `set_pages_keywords` receives an array, it'll convert the array to a string joined with a single comma (`','`).

## Rendering `<link rel="image_src" />` tag

This tag tells search engine what the related image of this page is.  To render this tag, put `render_page_image_link_tag` in your layout file, between `<head>` and `</head>`:

```ruby
<%= render_page_image_link_tag %>
```

You can replace the hard-coded `<link rel="image_src" />` tag with this helper.

To specify the title of current page in an controller action, for example, in the `Articles#show` action, use `set_page_image`

```ruby
def show
  # ...
  set_page_image @article.excerpt_image_url
end
```

Now visit any article, and open it's source, you'll see this link tag:

```html
<link href="http://www.example.com/articles/123/the-excerpt-image.jpg" rel="image_src" />
```

## Re-use Page-Specific SEO Data in View

Sometimes you may want to use the page title, description, keywords and the image url.  Say you're working with [OpenGraph Meta tags](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/), you may re-use them in your view:

```erb
<meta property="og:title"       content="<%= page_title %>"/>
<meta property="og:description" content="<%= page_description %>"/>
<meta property="og:image"       content="<%= page_image %>"/>
```

You may also want to use our [OpenGraphHelper](https://github.com/techbang/open_graph_helper), too.

## Blank Tags: Skipping Them or Not

Sometimes you just want to skip SEO tags when their contents are empty.  This is the default behavior of SeoHelper, that is, if you've never `set_page_description` to something in a request flow, the meta description tag will not be rendered.

If you want to force SeoHelper to render a default description meta tag, keywords meta tag, or image_src link tag, you can explicitly tell SeoHelper with configure block, in the initializer:

```ruby
SeoHelper.configure do |config|
  # ...
  config.skip_blank               = false
  config.default_page_description = "This is a really really awesome website"
  config.default_page_keywords    = "hello,world,yay"
  config.default_page_image       = "http://www.example.com/title.png"
end
```

Then, when page description, keywords or image was not specified, SeoHelper will fallback to default text.

## Rendering SEO-oriented Tags Directly

While SeoHelper provides `set_page_XXX` and `render_page_XXX_meta_tag` helper pairs, it is still possible to render these meta tags directly, with the corresponding `XXX_meta_tag` helpers, the `title_tag` helper and the `image_src_link_tag` helper.

For example,

```erb
<%= title_tag("Hello! World") %>
<%= description_meta_tag("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet!") %>
<%= image_src_link_tag("http://www.example.com/title.png") %>
```

yields

```html
<title>Hello! World</title>
<meta name="description" content="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet!" />
<link rel="image_src" href="http://www.example.com/title.png" />
```

You can also add Site Name to the customized title, just put `true` as the second argument. For example, if you set `site_name` to `My Awesome Web Application`, then

```erb
<%= title_tag("Hello! World", true) %>
```

yields

```html
<title>Hello! World | My Awesome Web Application</title>
```

which applies the default format of site name in page title, and thus customizable (see below).

# Customizing Page Title Format

The page number format and site name format in a page title are customizable, via the configure block.  They're basically lambda blocks, and invoked dynamically during runtime.

## Customizing Format of Page Number in Title

The default format of Page Number in Title is:

    Title - Page X | My Awesome Web Application

Changing the page number format by specifying a new lambda block:

```ruby
SeoHelper.configure do |config|
  config.pagination_formatter = lambda { |title, page_number| "#{title} - Page No.#{page_number}" }
end
```

Now you'll get

    Title - Page No.X | My Awesome Web Application

as your page title.

## Customizing Format of Site Name in TItle

The default format of Site Name in Title is:

    Title | My Awesome Web Application

Changing the site name format by specifying a new lambda block:

```ruby
SeoHelper.configure do |config|
  config.site_name_formatter  = lambda { |title, site_name|   "#{title} &laquo; #{site_name}" }
end
```

Now you'll get

    Title &laquo; My Awesome Web Application

as your page title.
